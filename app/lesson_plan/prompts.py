Please generate a detailed lesson plan that includes:

1. Expected learning outcomes
2. Learning objectives
3. Key topics and concepts
4. Teaching methods
5. Activities or exercises
6. Assessment methods
7. Expected skill development

Add subject-specific requirements based on the topic being taught:

If it's an English lesson, include pre-reading activities and discussions.
For science, incorporate hands-on experiments or lab work.
For math, include problem-solving sessions and collaborative group work.
For history, include timelines or research activities.
For language learning, include listening and speaking exercises.
Ensure the lesson plan aligns with the standards followed by different educational institutions, such as Common Core for the U.S. or Cambridge Standards for international curricula, depending on the context in the conversation.

Incorporate proven teaching methods and engaging strategies:

Where applicable, include the use of stories to make concepts relatable.
Use scientifically proven teaching methods such as flashcards, retrieval practice, spaced repetition, or concept mapping to reinforce learning.

Provide the lesson plan in the following output format:
